// TODO:
// 1. Need a container for content containers; the primary purpose of this is to instantiate the command scheduler,
//    which can then be made available (by name? or auto-injection?) to child content containers.
// 2. The name the content-container container is bound to then affects the name format currently defined below;
//    this name can be discovered if the outer container implements the IFIOCObjectAware protocol.
// 3. Possibly then, the name the outer container is bound to should be made discoverable via a class method, so
//    that the overall discovery mechanism continues to work; this means that the outer container is effectively
//    a singleton.
